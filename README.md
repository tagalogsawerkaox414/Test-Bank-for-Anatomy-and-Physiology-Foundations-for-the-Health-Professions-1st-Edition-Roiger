  * Roiger and Bullock’s unique pedagogical and visual approach helps students make the important connections between systems and learn how the body functions normally in homeostasis, and how disruption of homeostasis leads to disease and disorder. With a straightforward, engaging writing style, the authors explain difficult concepts in the context of routine activities, making concepts easier to grasp. Measurable learning outcomes throughout the textbook, workbook, and digital learning and assessment program help direct students through the content so there are no surprises.
